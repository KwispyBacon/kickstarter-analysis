# kickstarter-analysis
The purpose of this analysis of the Kickstarter data sheet was to sufficiently and accurately calculate the Outcomes of the 
kickstarters given in two separate ways: Outcomes based on the Start Date and Goals, as well as the Success, Failure, and Canceled
rate according to the month they were started.
I sorted the Outcomes in two separate ways: Outcomes Based on Start Date and Outcomes Based on the Goals.

## Outcomes Based on Goals Set
![Outcomes_vs_Goals](https://bit.ly/3NNUpJn)

For the graph above I first filtered the data from the Kickstarter sheet down to when the campaigns started
and what the goals of them were. I specifically filtered the Parent Category and Years of the campaigns and implemented them
into a pivot table. Using the pivot table as a reference, I created a chart 
to display a simpler visual reference of three different outcome types: successful, failed, and canceled. Some challenges
I faced while doing this were sorting the pivot table and chart accordingly, since I am still fairly new to excel and the 
in depth look we have been doing in these modules.

### Theater Outcomes By Launch

In the graph above, I gathered a few sets of information to make it, including the goal amount, how many kickstarters were 
successful/failures/canceled, as well as the total amount of projects, in order to calculate the percentages of how many kickstarters were 
successful/failures/canceled. I then created a pivot table based on a variety of integral values and filtered by the percentage
of how many kickstarters succeeded/failed/got canceled. Based on this table, I drew up a line chart in order to show the information in a more simplistic and easy-to-understand format. I did have some troubles with finding the 
correct formulas and fixing the ones that came through as errors. The tip video and modules helped a lot and I am sure I will
feel more comfortable with this module topic with practice and experience to come.

#### Conclusions

My first conclusion is as follows: in the graph entitled "Theater Outcomes By Launch", there is a significant increase in success rate 
around the April-June months, and the positive correlation of this graph may indicate that the success rate has something to do with the
seasonal change. I bring that up because towards the fall/winter months of Oct-Jan, there is a negative correlation until it 
becomes spring/summer again.
---
My second conclusion is that I noticed an abnormality in the "Goals" graph with the success rate line. There is a large increase of success
rate as you read towards the higher set goals. I find it abnormal because prior to that increase of success rate there is an
increase of failure and canceled rate. It seems that maybe those kickstarter campaigns can correlate to the first 
conclusion I came to, which is that they may have been started up around the April-June months (spring/summertime).

##### Limitations
Some limitations in this analysis are that the most recent gathered information is from 2017; the data given is outdated by
5 years and may not give an accurate representation of current information. Another limitation
can possibly be that there is no location given for each of these kickstarters, so we do not know where the specific
categories are succeeding, failing etc. With that information, we can filter down to Louise's location and find out what 
her kickstarters success rate is and around when she should start it.

###### Additions
I think if we can add more recent data and filter the data between the range of 2017-2022, the analysis can be more relevant. I also
believe that if we specify the location of where we collected the data of each kickstarter (such as city and country), we can obtain a better idea of where the kickstarters are succeeding geographically.
